# VALORANT RULE-TAIM

VALORANT RULE-TAIM is a simple GUI that randomly chooses agents and weapons from the Riot game VALORANT. The written code is based on the principle of object-oriented programming, as it mainly consists of one class composed of multiple functions that are in charge of generating random numbers, using them to select the agents and weapons from a given pool, and display their images on the screen, all according to the input given by the user. The GUI was created using the Tkinter library.

The program has three distinct functions:
* The first option allows the user to randomly choose any number of agents from the game (as long as it's equal to or smaller than the currently available number of agents in the game), independently of the agents' roles.
* The second option allows the user to randomly choose any number of weapons from the game.
* The third option allows the user to randomly choose any number of agents from the game according to their role:
  * Controllers
  * Duelists
  * Initiators
  * Sentinels
  
 My goal with this simple program is for casual players of the game to have an extra layer of fun by letting the program choose what agents and weapons to play. The code is up to date with the VALORANT 6.0 patch.
